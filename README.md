# âœ¨ PRG AI Blocks for How to Train Your Robot

[How to Train Your Robot](httyr.media.mit.edu) is a 1-week curriculum for middle school students to explore artificial intelligence and ethics.

In this course, students participate in a range of hot-topic discussions and hands-on, creative activities to learn about how artificial intelligence is impacting society today. Students will design robot companions to solve real-world problems and use machine learning to make them intelligent. At the end of the course, you will have designed your very own robot companion to share with the world.

This is NOT SCRATCH, it is an experimental extension of Scratch 3.0 that we've designed for students and educators to use as they explore AI with our curriculum. This is specifically the version of blocks that we used during Summer 2020 for the Amazon Future Engineer workshops.

Access the blocks [here](https://mitmedialab.github.io/prg-extension-boilerplate/robotafe). See [this page](httyr.media.mit.edu/tutorials) to see videos and other materials we created to help students learn to use these tools.

When you load the page, all of the blocks for the extensions we added to Scratch are available at the bottom of the toolbox. They include:
- PRG Micro:bit Robot Blocks. This curriculum includes an optional, Bluetooth robot that students can program to drive, play music, flash lights, and sense the environment.
- Teachable Machine. Using [Google's Teachable Machine](teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) tool, students can train custom image recognition models and then export the model for use in their block-based programs. In this version, students can only use image models, but in the most recent version they can use image, pose, and audio models.
- Text Classification. We built an interface directly into Scratch that leverages Google's Universal Sentence Encoder \cite{tfjs2020universal,cer2018universal} and TensorflowJS K Nearest Neighbors library \cite{tfjs2020knn} to perform text classification.

The most recent version of the blocks used for the How to Train Your Robot Curriculum are available [here](https://mitmedialab.github.io/prg-extension-boilerplate/httyr/).
