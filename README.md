# Scratch-like Coding Environment Boilerplate

This is intended to be a repository that makes it simple to play with and deploy a Scratch-3.0-like GUI! It may be handy for:

- Developing prototype Scratch 3.0 extensions that don't fit within the current extension limitations
- Experimenting with tweaks to the Scratch GUI
- Quickly deploying a fork of the Scratch 3.0 GUI

It is not so great for:

- Pushing small changes back to upstream Scratch often (it's possible, and this project retains the git history of the constituent sub-projects, but there's an extra messy step to get your work together for a pull request)

It is structured as a monorepo, where the Scratch components you'll typically want to modify live within the repository so you can edit them all at once, manage their versions all in one place, and perform a simple static site deploy of the GUI with the synced dependencies.

- [packages/scratch-gui](packages/scratch-gui)
- [packages/scratch-vm](packages/scratch-vm)
- [packages/scratch-render](packages/scratch-render)
- [packages/scratch-blocks](packages/scratch-blocks)

## Quick Setup!

```shell script
git clone git@github.com:mitmedialab/prg-scratch-extension-boilerplate.git
# Cloning the full history (300mb) takes about 20 seconds on fast internet. Include -â€“depth 1 for a 4 second checkout
npx lerna bootstrap --force-local
# This will symlink the packages together to allow for seamless local development, and installs dependencies for each package
# Takes about 1.5 minutes
cd packages/scratch-gui
npm start

# Open http://0.0.0.0:8601/ in your browser
```

Now you can make changes, and they will auto-build from the scratch-gui watcher and live-reload!

- render, gui, and vm will auto-build while `scratch-gui`'s `npm start` is running (as in steps above)
- the blocks component currently requires manually building and re-starting the GUI build:
    ```shell script
    # Make your change to scratch-blocks, then:
    cd packages/scratch-blocks
    npm run prepublish
    # And re-start scratch-gui's npm start
    ```

### Troubleshooting

#### If you see `sh: webpack: command not found`:

```shell script
> scratch-render@0.1.0 build /Users/brian/code/aied/test/test2/packages/scratch-render
> webpack --progress --colors
sh: webpack: command not found
```

**Solution**: This may mean you have a half-installed node_modules version of webpack. Try starting fresh!

## How this was made:

```shell script
npx lerna init
cd .. && mkdir scratch-fresh && cd scratch-latest
git clone https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm.git
git clone https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui.git
git clone https://github.com/LLK/scratch-render.git
git clone https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks.git
cd prg-scratch-extension-boilerplate
npx lerna import ../scratch-latest/scratch-vm --preserve-commit --flatten 
npx lerna import ../scratch-latest/scratch-gui --preserve-commit --flatten 
npx lerna import ../scratch-latest/scratch-render --preserve-commit --flatten 
npx lerna import ../scratch-latest/scratch-blocks --preserve-commit --flatten 
```
